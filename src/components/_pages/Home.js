        <p>If you’re thinking about adopting a cat or kitten, Feline Rescue is a smart choice. By adopting a Feline Rescue pet you’ll be supporting our caring, no-kill organization and making room for one more homeless cat. We’re always looking for good, safe, loving homes for our many cats and kittens.

All of our cats receive high-quality veterinary care and exams. Prior to adoption, all of our cats and kittens are FeLV/FIV tested; spayed/neutered, treated for external and internal parasites, microchipped, and FVRCP (distemper) vaccinated. We charge an adoption fee to offset part of these costs.</p>
